*Made a couple design changes for the app. Refer to images for representation.
**SQLite DB needs to be a java class in the app. Refer to databaseHelper.java example located in the project

1) App currently launches from the Homepage activity because login activity is not implemented yet. When ready can change
the app to launch from the login activity by changing a couple lines of code in the Android Manifest. To do this swap the
class names of LoginActivity and Homepage within the activity tags.

2) Not sure what the search button is supposed to do. So left the Search and Logout button's functionality to be implemented later. 
Though the buttons itself works and are responsive to clicks.

3) Submit buttons for the surveys work and are responsive but their function needs to be implemented. Left that up to whoever is
doing the SQLite DB since that data will be feed to the db on submission. Also that same data needs to update the profile page when 
submitted as well, so a functionality should be created for that as well.

4)Currently still working on implementing the UI for the MATCHES and PROFILE screens. Besides that the UI is built for everything else.
