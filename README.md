For app deployment:

In Android Studio, you need to create an instance for a virtual device (we use a Pixel 2) running API of 28 or greater.
You need to import the project from the file system after cloning the the project.

After import, you need to build the project, launch the instance of the virtual device, and run the project.

The login page should pop up on your virtual device.
